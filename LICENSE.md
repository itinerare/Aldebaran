## Do I need a private license?

If Ars Errabunda is of use to you and you are able, I would appreciate if you would support me (even a small amount is appreciated!) regardless of whether or not you are using it for commercial purposes! Contributing in other ways, such as contributing code, community support, and so on are likewise much appreciated and good ways to give back.

This won't cover every use-case (noncommercial organizations being the notable exception), but hopefully should provide some general clarity into what does or does not require a private license (including patron and any other custom licenses):

- I set up *Ars Errabunda* locally or on a webserver and use it to showcase my art, projects, etc. in a way that does not generate or contribute to generating any income. I do not modify its source code.
    - No private license necessary.
- I use *Ars Errabunda* in a way that generates or contributes to generating any income, but do not modify it.
    - Yes, you need a private license!
- I set up and/or modify *Ars Errabunda* for another party, free of charge.
    - No private license necessary.
- I set up and/or modify *Ars Errabunda* for another party, and charge a fee for doing so.
    - Yes, you need a private license! The other party, however, does not as long as they abide by the public license.
- I use *Ars Errabunda* for a portfolio site in a way that generates or contributes to generating any income, but do not use its commission-related functionality.
    - Yes, you need a private license!
- I use *Ars Errabunda*, including its commission-related functionality, but in a way that does not generate or contribute to generating any income.
    - No private license necessary. I'd be curious to hear how you're using it, though!
- I use *Ars Errabunda*, including its commission-related functionality, in a way that generates or contributes to generating any income.
    - Yes, you need a private license!
- I use *Ars Errabunda* in a way that does not generate or contribute to generating any income, and modify its functionality to better suit my needs.
    - No private license necessary. Consider publishing your changes and-- if they are broadly applicable-- making a pull request to this repository!
- I am an individual and/or single-developer company, and I want to use *Ars Errabunda* and make changes (including but not limited to building a non-open-source project or product) in a way that generates or contributes to generating any income.
    - Yes, you need a private license; in this case a [Patron License](LICENSE-PATRON.md) will do.
